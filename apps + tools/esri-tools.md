[The Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) has developed some tools to enhance the way we see our worldüó∫Ô∏è. The coming of web-based geographic information systems (GIS) has modernized the way we interact with geospatial data and tools. Here is a set of tools developed by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) that will advance your work. 

### Web Applications

- [Sentinel-2 Land Cover Explorer](https://arcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=efd2d197cc6742598b463adfa7505ed2) - _One of the foremost capabilities of this app is the dynamic change analysis. The app provides dynamic visual and statistical change by comparing annual slices of the Sentinel-2 10m Land Use/Land Cover data as you explore the map._


- [Landsat Explorer](https://livingatlas2.arcgis.com/landsatexplorer/) - _Created for you to visualize our planet and understand how the Earth has changed over time, the Esri Landsat Explorer app provides the power of Landsat satellites, which gather data beyond what the eye can see. Use this app to draw on Landsat's different bands to better explore the planet's geology, vegetation, agriculture, and cities. Additionally, access Landsat imagery from the last forty years to visualize how the Earth's surface has changed over time._


- [Landsat Explorer - (beta)](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landsatexplorer/) - _Landsat multispectral imagery helps to track and document land use and land change associated with climate change, urbanization, drought, wildfire, deforestation, and other natural processes and human activity.Through an intuitive user experience, this app leverages a variety of ArcGIS capabilities to explore and begin to unlock the wealth of information that Landsat provides._


- [Sentinel-2 Explorer](https://sentinel2explorer.esri.com/) - _Created for you to visualize our planet and understand how the Earth has changed over time, the Esri Sentinel Explorer app provides the power of Sentinel satellites, which gather data beyond what the eye can see. Use this app to draw on Sentinel's different bands to better explore the planet's geology, vegetation, agriculture, and cities. Additionally, access the entire Sentinel archive to visualize how the Earth's surface has changed since June 2015._
